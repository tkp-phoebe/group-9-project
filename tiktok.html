        <h2><b><u><a id="C5">Concerns</a></u></b></h2>
        <h3>
            <ol><li>Many were also concerned with the app affecting users' attention spans due to the short-form nature of the content.</li> 
            This is a concern as many of TikTok's audience are younger children, whose brains are still developing.
            <li>TikTok executives and representatives have noted and made aware to advertisers on the platform that users have poor attention spans.</li>
            With a large amount of video content, nearly 50% of users find it stressful to watch a video longer than a minute and a third of users watch videos at double speed.
            <li>TikTok has also received criticism for enabling children to purchase coins which they can send to other users.</li>
